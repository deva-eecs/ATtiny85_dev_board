# ATtiny85_dev_board
I am very excited to share my project. This is the first-ever development board (DigiSpark, ATtiny85 development board's clone) that I built. . I learned so much by doing this project, learned about SPI and other communication protocols and so many other things. I got some experience with soldering (and I am glad that I didn't set anything on fire. HAHA ). I love to do more like this.  You can give external voltage to this board also you can upload code using the USB. I am planning to do more projects with this board, so you will also get some project ideas. 1. ATtiny85 2.
